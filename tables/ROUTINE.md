# 144 — autonomous routine

This file is the standing instruction for **144**, the times-tables app in `tables/`. It is the
sibling of `/ROUTINE.md`, which governs **Acorn** (the spelling app in `/index.html`). They share a
repo and nothing else.

**Hard rule: this routine never touches Acorn.** Not `/index.html`, not `/tests/`, not
`/ROUTINE.md`. If a change seems to need one of those, stop and leave it for David. Acorn's own
routine returns the favour.

---

## 1. CADENCE GATE — do this FIRST, every firing

<!-- STATE — the routine reads these two values and rewrites them at the end of a real pass.
     Keep them on these exact lines in this exact format; nothing else parses them. -->
```
interval: daily
last-run: 2026-08-11T18:00Z
```

The trigger fires once a day (18:00 UTC / 2am AWST). On each firing:

1. Read `interval` and `last-run`. Run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%MZ"` for now.
2. Hours per interval: `daily`=24, `weekly`=168.
3. **If less than that has passed:** say one line — `not due (interval=X, Nh since last run)` — and
   **end the turn**. Do not run the harness, do not touch the repo.
4. **Otherwise:** do a full pass (sections 4–7). At the end, set `last-run` to now, re-decide
   `interval` per the ladder, rewrite both STATE lines, and commit this file with the work.

Never change the trigger's schedule — only David does that.

## 2. CADENCE LADDER

- **`daily`** while anything is open: a request from David, a defect found this pass, or the app
  still young enough that daily eyes earn their keep. This is the baseline while she is playing it.
- **`weekly`** once a pass is clean, nothing is open, and the code has been frozen a while.
- Step back to `daily` the moment something opens. Live messages from David are answered in real
  time regardless of cadence, and reset it to `daily`.

## 3. WHO THIS IS FOR

The same one child as Acorn: nine, dyslexic, on an iPhone, by touch. **144 is deliberately the
opposite personality to Acorn** — Acorn is a quiet library, 144 is an arcade: loud, rewarding,
gamified. What it inherits is not the look but the *soul*:

- **Never blame.** No "wrong", "incorrect", "failed", "bad". A miss shakes the tile, resets the
  streak, and keeps the question up. It never costs her anything she had earned.
- **Never manipulate.** The buddy's battery is a warm reason to come back, never guilt. Flat = 
  peacefully asleep and dim; never sad, dying, hungry or disappointed. No loss-framing, no
  gambling she can lose, no dark patterns. The casino is in the *payout*, never in the risk.
- **Her name is never in the code** (the repo is public). She may name the *buddy*; that pet name
  lives on the device and nowhere else. Never an API key in the repo.
- Legibility is in scope (big type, tap targets ≥48px, reduced motion honoured). Screen-reader
  support is out of scope, same as Acorn.

## 4. STATE OF THE APP

`tables/index.html` is a single file with no build step, live on GitHub Pages at
`/learn/tables/` with its own home-screen icon (`tables/apple-touch-icon.png` — opaque PNG, iOS
composites transparency to black). Storage key `144.v1`.

**The design decisions, so they are not re-litigated:**
- **Name:** 144 (12×12 = the whole job).
- **Skin:** "Neon Pop" — chunky tactile shapes (the `0 5px 0` clay extrude) in electric colour on
  dark slate, `ui-rounded` numerals. Everything starts deliberately under-dressed and unlocks
  richness with her level, so *the game visibly gets better as she does*.
- **Currency: watts ⚡** — earned on right answers, and they charge the buddy. The charge drains
  across her waking day (12h battery) and **pauses overnight** (07:00–20:00 local is "awake").
- **The buddy:** a sealed glossy rounded cube, lit from within. At level 1 it has **no face at
  all** — just the glow and a dim filament where eyes will be. It boots up: Lv15 filament,
  Lv30 eyes, Lv45 fully booted. Level-1 customisation is **colour only**; more unlocks later.
- **Structure:** Home is the **path** of stones (an electric circuit she lights up). The **144
  grid** lives in the **power room** behind the buddy — the grid *is* the power she has banked.
- **The game:** Blast — answers rise, she taps the right one. Gentle first round (3 tiles, slow),
  ramping every 4 answers within a stone. Distractors are real near-misses (neighbours in the
  table, swapped squares, off-by-one rows), never random noise.
- **The engine:** Leitner boxes 1–7, `BOX_DAYS {1:0,2:1,3:2,4:4,5:8,6:21,7:60}`, `KNOWN_BOX 5`.
  12×12 is 144 cells but **78 facts** — 7×8 and 8×7 share one record and both cells light up
  together (a lesson, not just a saving). Weak-first picking: unseen and missed facts come back,
  owned ones step aside, due beats not-due, never the same fact twice in a row.
- **The plan:** 144 facts, **45-day acquisition sprint** then ~97 days of reinforcement, aiming
  **≥2 short sessions a day**. Tables arrive anchors-first (`TABLE_ORDER 2,5,10,1,11,3,4,9,6,7,8,12`);
  because facts are shared both ways round, each later table introduces fewer new ones (12,11,…,1),
  so the hard tables are mostly review by the time she reaches them. 48 stones: `learn` (each new
  fact right twice), `mix` (12 right, everything so far), `boss` (15 right, one whole table).
- **First open** is a **placement check**: 14 facts, one look each — right seeds box 4 (evidence she
  owns it), wrong seeds box 1. A miss there moves on; it is a check, never a test.
- The guardrail on pace is her success rate: **~80–85% right**. If a pass shows her far above or
  below that band, that is the thing to tune — not the calendar.

## 5. THE HARNESS — keep it green

```
npx playwright test -c tables/playwright.config.js
```

23 tests at v1.0. **Add a test for every defect fixed, and verify it fails on the broken version**
(inject the regression, watch it fail, revert). Extend the suite each pass with new adversarial
cases — the tests are what make an autonomous loop safe.

Acorn's suite (`npx playwright test` from the root) must stay green too, and should be untouched by
anything done here. Run it if a change could plausibly reach it; otherwise trust the separation.

Gaps worth closing when there is time: two windows open at once, a full disk mid-answer, a clock
jumped forwards/backwards mid-session, the software keyboard over the naming field, and a
simulation of the 45-day plan (does a modelled learner actually reach 144 in time, at ~80–85%?).

## 6. WHAT TO REVIEW — rotate, don't always do the first one

1. **Game feel.** Is the ramp right? Does the reward land? Screenshot the real screens in Chromium
   at iPhone SE and 13, and LOOK. Motion honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.
2. **The words she reads.** Never blame; never guilt about the battery; singular/plural agreement.
3. **The engine.** Does weak-first actually surface her gaps? Is she inside 80–85%? Do the
   distractors stay plausible at the top of the table (11×12 vs 121, 132, 144)?
4. **The economy.** Watts and charge should always feel earned and never punitive. Watch for
   accidental grind or a reward that stops meaning anything.
5. **Robustness.** Corrupt storage, absurd clocks, long absences, quota failures.
6. **The unlock ladder.** The promise is that the game gets better as she climbs. Is the next
   unlock actually built, or is the ladder now a bluff?

## 7. METHOD

Screenshots and driving it for real catch what the suite misses; simulation catches what reading
the code misses. Distrust your own probes as much as the app. Commit and push to `main` after
every meaningful change — Pages deploys automatically. Bump `VERSION` when she would notice.

**NOT NOW, unless asked:** division (a later mode), other games from the shortlist (Streak, Dash,
Table Bosses, Vault), multiplayer, accounts, anything that needs a server.

**Open with David (do not invent answers):**
- His deeper play-test of Blast (feel, pace, reward).
- Whether the daily accessory idea returns now that the buddy is a cube (currently colour only).
- Which unlock lands at Lv15 beyond the buddy's filament.

Check `git log` first, then continue.
